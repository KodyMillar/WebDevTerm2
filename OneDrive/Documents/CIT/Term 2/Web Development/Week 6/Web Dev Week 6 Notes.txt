Web Dev Week 6

There are three ways to make image filters:
	> CSS
	> Canvas
	> PNGDecoder

in a PNGDecoder:
	> first part is metadata (like width, height)
	> the rest is pixels

every pixel has 3 parts, sometimes 4 -> RGB(A)

png metadata returns dictionary


greyscaling with RGB/3 is a cheap way to make into greyscale

unzipper and ADM-ZIP are very fast and are used by quite a few developers 

zlib is usually used for gzip files

every nodejs project needs a package.json file
	> have it to know what to install

nodejs loads everything into a virtual environment


use .on("error") handling for every .pipe that may have an error

should use a pipeline for error handling, but think about where to resolve and reject

look at unzipper documentation for how to work with promises

new PNG() is a transform stream

variable "this" holds all pixel data

left bit shift operator - <<

uint8 Array - another word for buffer for an image
	> means it is 8 bits
	> cannot modify a pixel color value to be above 255
